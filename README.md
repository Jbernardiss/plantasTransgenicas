## About

  This app was created when I had to do a biology class presentation. So to do something different and practice some web programming I decided to do a website.
  The website was created by me alone(the other people given credit in the website researched a part of the site content) with React JS and Next.js.
  The deploy was made with Vercel.
  
  Overall this was a good project with satisfactory results(got a 9.5 or -A)and I was able to learn the basics of React and website making by puting my skills in a real project.
